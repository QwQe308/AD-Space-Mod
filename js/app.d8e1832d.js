This means that clearing your browser's cache or cookies, or fully\nuninstalling the game from Steam will also delete your save file.\nSimilarly, if you are playing in a private or incognito window, your save\nwill not be there the next time you open up your browser. The saves are browser-specific as well, so for example\nif you play the game on Chrome, you will not find your save on Firefox. Lastly, any saves you have on the web version\nand the Steam version will also be completely independent from each other.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou can transfer your save between places by using the export function, which will copy a <i>very</i> long string of\nrandom-looking characters into your clipboard. That text contains your save data, which you can load back into the\ngame by pasting it into the text box on the import prompt. You need the entirety of the save text for importing to\nwork properly, or else the game might not recognize the text as a valid save.

In addition to importing and exporting to your clipboard, you can also import\nand export from text files as well.\n<br>\nYou can use the "Choose save" button to pick between three separate saves on your browser. These saves are, for most\nintents and purposes, completely separate from each other. Importing and exporting will only affect the current save\nslot. <b>The only exception is clearing your browser or Steam data, in which case all three saves will be reset.</b>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe game automatically saves periodically, by default once every ${formatInt(30)} seconds.\nKeep this in mind if you need to close the game - anything you\ndo right before closing it might not be saved unless you wait for the autosave interval or manually save again. The\nlength of the autosave interval is adjustable, and its timer can be seen in the bottom-left of the screen.\n<br>\n<br>\nBackups of your savefile are also saved after certain amounts of time online or offline, which you can examine and\nreload at any point by clicking the "Open Automatic Save Backup Menu" button.

This allows you to play\nwith the same save on any device which is also logged into the same account.

The simulation behavior is only somewhat accurate, as the game is too mathematically\ncomplicated to be run at full accuracy in a reasonable amount of time. At the end of the simulation, the game will\nsummarize how various relevant resources have changed while you were gone.\n<br>\n<br>\nIf the game is left open and becomes unfocused or otherwise suspended for an extended period of time, it will attempt\nto apply the missed time as offline progress when you return. This can be potentially unreliable, as different devices\nhandle these situations differently. If this results in undesirable behavior, there is a toggle to turn this off in the\noptions - in that case the game will try to apply all the missed time in a single tick.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe game runs on a system where everything is updated once per tick - all Dimensions and resources do one unit of\nproduction, all autobuyers trigger once, all multipliers and values are changed accordingly, and all the displayed\nnumbers are updated. By default there are ${formatInt(20)} ticks per second when the game is running, although this can\nbe modified by changing the "Update rate" within the game Options.\nYour current settings will run the game at ${format(1e3/player.options.updateRate,2,1)} ticks per second on\naverage, although lag and internal javascript behavior may cause individual ticks to vary by a few percent.\n<br>\n<br>\nWhen offline simulation is active, these ticks have an adjusted length in order to fill the amount of time you were\naway - for example having a setting for ${formatInt(1e3)} offline ticks and closing the game for an hour will result in\nticks which are ${format(3.6,1,1)} seconds long each. For most things in the game, this is not an issue because this\nwill still result in approximately the same amount of resources after the simulation completes. A notable exception is\nautobuyers - in this situation autobuyers will effectively only trigger once every ${format(3.6,1,1)} seconds, which\nmay have a strong impact depending on the part of the game.\n<br>\n<br>\n${player.blackHole[0].unlocked?'<b>Offline Black Hole behavior:</b> Once the Black Hole has been unlocked, the offline progress simulation will\n      attempt to run the game in a way where each tick contains roughly the same amount of <i>game</i> time. This may\n      give the appearance of the Black Hole(s) being active for a much larger fraction of time than normal while\n      simulating, when in fact the game is running active periods more slowly and "skipping past" the inactive periods\n      because they contribute much less production per real time.

This may have potentially adverse effects on your script's\nbehavior while offline, depending on how exactly your script depends on the game state to work properly.\nAdditionally, the PAUSE command may behave oddly due to it also being based on real time.\n`,isUnlocked:()=>Player.automatorUnlocked,tags:["automation","reality","code","script","endgame","lategame"],tab:"automation/automator"},{name:"Black Hole",info:()=>`\nThe Black Hole is a feature which speeds up how fast the game runs, on a periodic cycle.\nThe game will run at normal speed for some amount of time, then have a burst of running extremely fast for a short\nperiod of time before going back to normal speed and repeating the cycle.\n<br>\n<br>\nIncreased game speed from Black Holes is much stronger than tickspeed because unlike tickspeed, it affects\n<i>everything equally</i>, including things which are only partially affected by tickspeed\n(eg. Infinity/Time Dimensions), things which are normally completely unaffected (eg. DT/TT generation),\nand effects which are boosted purely on time spent (eg. idle path IP/EP multipliers).\n<br>\n<br>\nWhile most features in the game are boosted by this increased game speed, there are some which remain unaffected.\nIn these cases, it will be specifically mentioned that a given time is stated as <i>real time</i> as opposed to\n<i>game time</i>. One such example is the set of Perks which automatically completes Eternity Challenges over time.\nOtherwise, it should be assumed from this point onward that all references to time are for <i>game time</i>.\nNote that this also includes situations where you may want to have a <i>lower</i> amount of time spent, like\nthe Reality Upgrade "Replicative Rapidity" for example.\n<br>\n<br>\nYou can buy upgrades for the Black Hole by using Reality Machines. There are three upgrades for the Black Hole:\n<br>\n<b>Interval</b> - How long the Black Hole is inactive between bursts,\nreduced by ${formatPercents(.2)} per upgrade.\n<br>\n<b>Power</b> - How much faster the game runs during the temporary speed bursts,\nincreased by ${formatPercents(.35)} per upgrade.\n<br>\n<b>Duration</b> - How long each speed burst lasts before going back to normal speed,\nincreased by ${formatPercents(.3)} per upgrade.\n<br>\n<br>\n${formatInt(100)} days of <i>game time</i> after unlocking the Black Hole, you unlock the ability to purchase\na Reality Upgrade that allows you to have a second Black Hole.\nThe timer on the second Black Hole only advances when the first Black Hole is active. So, for example, if the first\nBlack Hole has a duration of ${formatInt(4)} minutes and the second has an interval of ${formatInt(8)} minutes, the\nsecond Black Hole will only activate once every two cycles of the first Black Hole regardless of how short the\nfirst Black Hole's interval is. Note that the timer shown in the in-game header takes account of this and shows\nthe actual time until the second Black Hole activates; in the Black Hole tab, you can see the amount of time with\nthe first Black Hole active needed for the second Black Hole to activate.\n<br>\n<br>\nWhen a Black Hole is active at least ${formatPercents(.9999,2)} of the time, it becomes permanently active.\nThis is tracked separately for the two Black Holes.\n<br>\n<br>\nWhile offline, Black Hole cycles will still advance normally and their active speed boosts will apply fully as if the\ngame were still open. Offline time simulates segments of inactive and active Black Holes with different tick lengths\nin order to reduce the negative effects of small tick count during active periods; the entry for "Offline Progress"\nhas been updated with more technical details.\n<br>\n<br>\nThe Black Holes can be paused, completely halting their interval/duration cycle. However, when unpausing them, it will\ntake ${BlackHoles.ACCELERATION_TIME} real-time seconds for them to go from inactive to their maximum boosted speed.\nThis acceleration time will still advance the cycle as if it were running at full speed; so\nwhile pausing gives some more control, it also ultimately results in some boosted time being lost.\n<br>\n<br>\nPausing and unpausing affects both Black Holes; they cannot be paused or unpaused independently.

This system uses one of many methods to assign a score to your Glyph choices, and then picks the choice\nwith the highest score. After picking this Glyph, it checks the score against a threshold and either keeps it if the\nscore is above the threshold, or sacrifices it instead. There are three basic modes:\n<br>\n<b>Lowest total sacrifice:</b> Glyphs are given a score based on how much sacrifice value you have of that\nparticular Glyph's type. Glyphs of the type you have the least sacrifice value in will have the highest score.\nThis mode does not have a threshold and always sacrifices your Glyphs.\n<br>\n<b>Number of effects:</b> Glyphs are given a score equal to the number of effects they have, and when multiple\nGlyphs have the same effect count, Glyphs with higher rarity will be picked. The threshold they are\ncompared to is specified by your input in the text box.\n<br>\n<b>Rarity Threshold Mode:</b> Glyphs are given a score equal to their rarity percent. The comparison threshold\ncan be set individually per Glyph type.\n<br>\n<br>\nAdditionally, there are two more advanced modes with some additional flexibility. You may not need these initially, but\nthey can come in handy later on:\n<br>\n<b>Specified Effect Mode:</b> Glyphs are given a score equal to their rarity and checked against the rarity threshold\nyou specify, but this score is modified based on your inputs for effects. The Glyph will be checked for having a minimum\nnumber of effects and having all of the effects you choose, and its score is lowered by ${formatInt(200)} for every\nmissing effect. This guarantees that any Glyph that does not have the effects you want will be below the threshold. You\ncan forbid specific Glyph <i>types</i> by setting impossible conditions (eg. at least ${formatInt(6)} effects on a Power\nGlyph will prevent Power Glyphs from being selected).\n<br>\n<b>Effect Score Mode:</b> The score of a Glyph is calculated from its rarity plus the score of each effect it has,\nand you can set the threshold and values of each effect individually. Some possible ways this could be used:\n<br>\n- Giving a weaker effect a value of ${formatInt(5)} allows you to keep Glyphs without that effect as long as they are\nrarer to compensate for being weaker\n<br>\n- Assigning a large negative score to a certain effect you do <i>not</i> want will forbid Glyphs with that effect from\nbeing selected; this can be useful for effect testing and other more limited situations\n<br>\n- Setting an impossible condition (eg. a threshold score of ${formatInt(999)} and all effects worth ${formatInt(0)})\nwill let you forbid entire types like Specified Effect Mode as well\n<br>\n<br>\nThe Glyph Filter mode is a global setting which applies to all Glyph types at once; for example, you cannot filter\npower Glyphs with "Rarity Threshold" and time Glyphs with "Specified Effect".

Dark Matter is produced by\nDark Matter Dimensions, in a similar cascading way to all other types of dimensions in the game. Unlike other\ndimensions, there are only four Dark Matter Dimensions rather than eight. You start with the first one unlocked\nimmediately and the higher ones are unlocked via Imaginary Upgrades. When unlocking dimensions, you are given\n${formatInt(1)} of the dimension and cannot gain more without having it produced from the next tier up.\n<br>\n<br>\nEach Dark Matter Dimension, after a certain interval of time, generates two things: Dark Matter or the next lower\nDark Matter Dimension and another resource called Dark Energy. Dark Matter and Dark Matter Dimension production\nper interval is equal to the product of your Dark Matter multiplier and the number of dimensions you have, while\nDark Energy production is independent of your dimension amount. Dark Energy is used to produce Singularities, which\nhave their own How To Play entry.\n<br>\n<br>\nDark Matter Dimensions can have their intervals upgraded down to a minimum of ${formatInt(10)}ms, at which point\nyou cannot upgrade the interval any further.

You're f*cking dead,\n      kiddo."},{id:"a113",text:"So I've pondered this question for a long time. Antimatter Dimensions... what does it mean? I mean it's a\n      game, that's clear. You buy the first dimension, and it gives you antimatter, and the second dimension\n      provides more first dimensions and so on... But what does it mean? It can't just be a game, it seems too\n      plain for that. The developer must have made it as a metaphor. I was doing my weekly ritual of using the\n      fingernail clipper to cut my pubic hair, when finally the realization came to me. The dimensions are just\n      thinly veiled misspellings of the word 'depression'. Regular matter are the cruel and negative thoughts that\n      add to and fuel depression, while antimatter is the positive thoughts and good friends that dispel it. You\n      start off with something simple, and it fights almost imperceptibly against the depression, but as you keep\n      going the fight builds. But it never seems to fix everything. The depression seems like it could go on to\n      infinity. So you keep going. But eventually, you figure out, depression isn't infinite. It's just very very\n      large. But your 'dimensions' eventually, with enough work, make enough 'antimatter' to usurp that seeming\n      infinity of depression. Then the possibilities are endless. You are actually happy for once, and your\n      happiness grows exponentially as you go beyond and seemingly 'break' the 'infinity' of depression. And you\n      go on until that 'infinity' seems tiny in comparison to the happiness you've managed to achieve in your\n      life, where if you reset you get over that infinity in less than the blink of an eye. If you want to know\n      what the multiple layers of prestige are...'Dimensional Shifts' are getting new things and methods to give\n      you happiness. 'Dimension Boosts' are upgrading the things and methods. Examples would be getting a new car\n      being a 'Dimensional Shift' and trading that car in for a new one would be a 'Dimension Boost'. 'Eternities'\n      are major tragedies such as a loved one dying. That lapse brings you straight back to the beginning, with\n      seemingly no hope of return. But with time, you grow back stronger and happier than ever before. 'Dimensional\n      Sacrifice' is moving away. You have to give up a lot of the things you had that made you happy, but there is\n      new opportunity in where you move to. And that new opportunity gives you more happiness than you ever had.\n      'Tickspeed' is how easy it is to make you happy, and 'Time Dimensions' make it even easier to be happy.\n      Antimatter Dimensions is a metaphor for a depressed man's successful battle against his illness.",get unlocked(){return PlayerProgress.eternityUnlocked()}},{id:"a114",text:"(Make me sleep) Put me to sleep inside.

An M press actually has three parts to it: when M is pressed, when M is\n      held, and when M is released. Now, usually is the pressing that's useful because that's the only part that\n      matters; however, sometimes it's sufficient to just use the holding part, which also buys dimensions and\n      tickspeed upgrades. And as for the release, well, there are currently no cases where that's useful or\n      important, so don't worry about that part. Now, if we map out the required presses for challenge 2 it would\n      look like this: /¯\\. We merely need to hold (¯) M to reach the first galaxy, we need to press (/) M to\n      finish the challenge, and we need to press M again to start another challenge. So, how many presses is that\n      total? Well, it appears to be three, and if we were doing this Eternity in isolation then yes, it would be\n      three, but in a full-game M Button Challenge run there are other M presses that occur earlier in the run,\n      such as the M press needed for the first Infinity, so if we take that M press into consideration as well,\n      then how many M presses does it take? The naive answer would be four: one to enter the challenge, and the\n      three within the challenge we established earlier; however, we can do better. We can actually do it in\n      three by simply holding out the first M press to be used for the half M press, because the half M press only\n      required M to be held, not actually pressed, so in this fashion, Challenge 2 only adds on an additional two M\n      presses to the run, since the first M press just leeches off the previous M press. So to capture this\n      phenomenon, we call it 2.5 M presses. On a single Eternity basis, you'd round up that up to three, but in\n      a full game run, you'd round it down to two. So, in conclusion, since that first M press counts in some\n      contexts, but adds no additional presses in other contexts, we refer to it as a \"Half M Press\"."},{id:"a260",text:"It seems that the Replicanti have a very divide-and-conquer method of doing things.\n      Well, everything at this rate.",get unlocked(){return PlayerProgress.eternityUnlocked()||PlayerProgress.replicantiUnlocked()}},{id:"a261",text:"Antimatter Dimensions is actually a Roguelite game!

But, luckily\n      for you, snakes don't often take the initiative to bite - excluding the really mean ones. If they've gone out\n      of their way to bite you, there's generally 4 reasons. 1- The Snake is Mean. 2- You scared the snake. Snakes\n      are scary to you, but you are scary to snakes. Be the bigger lizard when you meet a snake. 3- You entered the\n      territory of the snake. Often, a snake will warn you if you do this - this is why rattle snakes rattle. If you\n      don't listen to the warning, they'll bite you. And the most important reason, 4- the snake finds you ugly.\n      This is the fault of the snake's ocular system, but is the most common form of bites in at least 2\n      jurisdictions. And if you get bitten by a snake, by virtue of being a scarily ugly lizard who keeps stumbling\n      into the wrong bushes, there's 3 main things you can do. First, calm down, again, and stay calm. Secondly,\n      immobilise the area around site that was bitten, and try using a compression bandage. Snake venom vision is\n      entirely based on movement of the object it's currently in. And third, calmly, call for help from other\n      lizards. Excluding the snake. The snake's too mean to help you."},{id:"a368",text:"I suspect more people would press the hard reset button if genuine effort was done to make the process as\n      miserable as possible. A slow removal of resources, with unique nerfs just to stop you from progressing.

Randomness, against the player for even the simplest actions, to punish the thought of\n      progression. Hooks and traps and disasters and low rolls for a chance see progression, which entirely consists\n      of putting the state of the game further from anything deemed reasonable. A situation where the character is\n      broken just to tell you to leave… but the damage is already done, if it is even possible to turn back.

Thousands of hours of time,\n      planning, effort, consultation, and political manoeuvring to create truly airbreaking endeavours.

The goal of the three R's, set out by the EMIF, was to\n      reinstate a mana trade corridor for SMSS (Small-Medium Steam Shuttles), a vital part of the burgeoning\n      consolidated states after their unfortunate pillaging during the NELC (ninth empire liberation crusade).\n      The three R's was a multi stage project - stage 1 was a survey glyph in the air - all big things start with\n      a small step. Stage 2, the unveiling of the EMOF (Empire Mechanical Obliteration Forcefield) had over 50\n      dignitaries - multiple emperors (from federated states to organisational leaders), foreign rulers, EMDF\n      (Effluent Manifested Destiny Families) who currently own the land, and even some of the forecast witches,\n      all gathered together to unveil the project in a show of EOSF (Empire Official Solidarity Friendships).\n      Sadly, the project was eventually cancelled at stage 215, as the creation of the EMTF (Excrement Material\n      Transmutation Facility) for the contractors exploded after coming into contact with a SMEA (Small-Medium\n      Electric Airship) placing the last survey peg from stage 459 due to a time vortex created by an argument\n      at the WAIC (Witches Annual Infrastructure Committee) as part of stage 56.
